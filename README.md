# blog-builder

> Blog-builder is a software tool that facilitates the creation of a blog powered by Jekyll using AWS S3. The blog's content is saved in a GitHub repository, and whenever a merge hook is triggered, it activates an AWS Lambda function to rebuild Jekyll and update the content in S3 automatically.
